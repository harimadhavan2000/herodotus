### Without API Key

The game works without an API key using fallback content, but you'll get:
- Limited predefined puzzles
- No custom category generation
- Basic hints instead of AI-generated ones

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"PORTKEY_API_KEY not found"**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key
   - Or run with fallback content (limited features)

2. **"Game files not found"**
   - Make sure you're running `python main.py` from the project directory

3. **Import errors**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies

4. **AI generation fails**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your Portkey API key is valid
   - The game will fall back to predefined content

### Dependencies

- `portkey-ai`: AI integration for content generation
- `rich`: Beautiful terminal user interface
- `fuzzywuzzy`: Fuzzy string matching for answers
- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

The game is designed to be extensible:

- **Add Categories**: Edit `data/categories.json` to add fallback content
- **Modify UI**: Customize colors and layouts in `game/ui.py`
- **Adjust Scoring**: Modify scoring logic in `game/game_state.py`
